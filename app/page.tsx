      <h2>What this blog is about</h2>
      
      <p>This blog shares my journey as an entrepreneur running my own small business.

While startups and large organizations get most of the attention, I found little assistance for those like me - forcing me to experiment and learn on my own. I chronicle that journey here to help others.</p>

<p>I plan to share my various tools, guides, lessons from entrepreneurial experience and hope it helps others in some form or other.</p>

<p>Beyond business, I&apos;m passionate about travel, photography, reading and music.  
This blog is a work in progress. I write out of curiosity, covering a wide range of topics. I hope those reading can find some topics that interest you.</p>
