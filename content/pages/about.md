## Short Intro

Hell, my name is Kiran Brahma. My typical Indian education and a diverse professional background provided me with a unique business experience.

I graduated from [Indian School of Business](https://isb.edu) and am a civil engineer from [NIT Hamirpur](https://nith.ac.in). My career has spanned multiple industries: infrastructure, telecom, transportation and cleantech.

My roles across MNC's, Startups and entreprenurial endeavours have given me valuable insights into operating and scaling businesses.

In 2019, I transitioned from my EV startup to taking over my late father's manpower services business which serves corporates across India.

## What this blog is all about


Running my own business has been one heck of a learning experience! I want to share the highs, lows and everything in between in hopes it helps other business owners.

Most resources focus on startups or big companies, but little helps us small fries. This means I've had to figure stuff out through trial and error.


Over the past few years, I've managed to develop tech tools, processes and hacks that I expect will add value for fellow small business owners.
  

Outside of work, I love traveling, photography, reading and jamming to music. I'll try weaving those passions into my blog in a way that's relevant for business folks.
  

This blog is a work in progress. I plan to cover whatever topics catch my interest. I'll organize posts so you can easily find what you're here for.

I write to share my experiences in hopes someone finds it useful, while providing an inside look at running a small business.
